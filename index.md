### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because it really had me thinking outside
    the box. I was having a problem where my gradient image only showed a
    green line at the bottom and a red line on the right side, each being a
    pixel wide. When trying to figure out the reason for this I tried so many
    things but was unable to figure what I did wrong. Then I finally figured
    out it was because my for loop was using type int instead of type double.
    One I had made the change the gradient was perfect.

* Lab 11
    
    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first time I really had
    to use classes in a way that required so much. When doing the lab I
    actually had no knowledge about classes since my class was a little behind
    everyone else. I had to do my own research to figure out how to use
    classes and by the end had learned a lot about them. I was amazed I was
    able to finish this part with the program executing with no issues when
    I had started it knowing nothing.

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because to me it was one of the more complex
    labs we had to do. The majority of the time I was just following instructions
    and wasn't expecting much to work. When I was testing the program it had
    failed pretty horribly. Turns out the program was reading each text file
    was assigning the entire paragraph to a string, instead of just a single
    word. I had to figure out a way to only have the words be assigned and not
    spaces. Doing so took so much time but I was glad to have it work in the
    end.
